# Eyes
A demonstration of a set of eyes following your arrow around the screen.
## Description
This is a simple project that animates a set of eyes to follow your arrow around the screen. These eyes do belong to a nice red dog.
### How To Use
It's easy. Simply open the Index.html file in your browser and move your arrow around to see the dog's eyes follow the arrow
## Future Improvements 
I'd like to revisit this project and add a moving tongue on the dog to make it a little more animated.
